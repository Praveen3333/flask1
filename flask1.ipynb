    "### Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flask** is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that provides tools and libraries for building web applications. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly build web applications with minimal boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Flask Framework:**\n",
    "1. **Lightweight**: Flask is lightweight and has minimal dependencies, making it easy to install and use.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: Flask allows developers to choose their preferred libraries and tools for various components of the web application, providing flexibility and customization.\n",
    "3. **Easy to Learn**: Flask has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy for beginners to learn and understand.\n",
    "4. **Modular Design**: Flask follows a modular design, allowing developers to add or remove features as needed without affecting other parts of the application.\n",
    "5. **Extensible**: Flask is extensible, with a rich ecosystem of extensions and plugins available for adding additional functionality to the web application.\n",
    "6. **Built-in Development Server**: Flask comes with a built-in development server, allowing developers to quickly test and debug their applications during development.\n",
    "7. **Jinja2 Templating**: Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, which provides powerful and flexible templates for generating dynamic HTML content.\n",
    "8. **Werkzeug WSGI Toolkit**: Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit, which provides low-level utilities for handling HTTP requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**App routing** in Flask refers to the process of mapping URL paths to view functions within a Flask application. It allows developers to define routes for different URLs and specify the functions that should be executed when those URLs are accessed by clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of app routes:**\n",
    "- **URL Mapping**: App routes define the mapping between URL paths and view functions, allowing clients to access different parts of the web application.\n",
    "- **Request Handling**: App routes specify the functions that should be executed when specific URLs are accessed, allowing developers to handle incoming requests and generate appropriate responses.\n",
    "- **Modular Design**: App routes promote a modular design by separating different components of the web application into distinct view functions, making the code more organized and maintainable.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Content**: App routes enable the creation of dynamic web pages by allowing view functions to generate HTML content based on the requested URL or parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/” route to show the following details:\n",
    "Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "Location: India\n",
    "Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",
    "    return 'Welcome to ABC Corporation'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def company_info():\n",
    "    return '''Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "              Location: India\n",
    "              Contact Detail: 999-999-9999'''\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the url_for() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `url_for()` function in Flask is used for URL building. It generates a URL for the specified endpoint using the URL rules defined in the application. This function takes the endpoint name and any additional arguments as parameters and returns the corresponding URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'Index Page'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/user/<username>')\n",
    "def user_profile(username):\n",
    "    return f'User Profile: {username}'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    with app.test_request_context():\n",
    "        print(url_for('index'))  # Output: /\n",
    "        print(url_for('user_profile', username='john'))  # Output: /user/john\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `url_for()` function is used to generate URLs for the `index` and `user_profile` endpoints. The generated URLs are printed to the console."
